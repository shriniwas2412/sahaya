# Sahaya

A gentle, voice-first companion for an older person living with dementia, set up by their family caregiver.
Hindi first, English too. Works offline on a low-cost Android phone as an installable web app (PWA).

> **Not a medical device.** Sahaya does not diagnose, assess a dementia stage, or give medical or dosage advice.
> Medicine support is a reminder with a "Taken" button and a caregiver alert. Nothing more.

## What it does

**Caregiver setup (7 steps).**
- Name, age or birth decade.
- Dementia stage on the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS 1–7), with one plain line per stage. The caregiver picks the stage a doctor or assessor gave, or "Not assessed". The app never guesses a stage.
- Language and dialect: Hindi, Bundeli, Malwi, Chhattisgarhi, Marathi (Varhadi), Gujarati, English.
- Likes, topics to avoid, extra worry words, energy pattern, evening restlessness (sundowning) window, life-story notes.
- Family contacts in call order, plus an optional helpline. Two helplines are offered as choices: Elderline 14567 and 112. Nothing is preselected.
- Medicines: name, dose as written on the prescription, times, instructions, and an escalation delay (default 30 min).
- Elder-mode PIN (4–6 digits, stored only as a salted PBKDF2 hash on the phone) and a recorded consent.

**Locked elder mode.**
- One calm, dark, high-contrast screen: the person's name, an optional family photo, a big Talk button, "say again", louder/softer, and a large Help button.
- The companion's name is "Sahaya" by default; the caregiver can rename it.
- If listening is not available (or not consented), Talk becomes four big tap buttons: yes, no, song, story.
- Medicine reminders appear on this screen with "ले ली / Taken" and "थोड़ी देर में / In a little while".
- Leaving elder mode: hold the top-right corner for 3 seconds, then enter the PIN. Five wrong PINs lock the pad for 30 seconds.

**Every turn runs in a fixed order:**
1. A deterministic safety screen (keyword lists in Hindi, Hinglish, English, Marathi and Gujarati, plus the caregiver's own words). It runs before anything else.
2. The caregiver's avoid-list. A match gets a gentle change of topic.
3. A stage-aware reply. By default this is an offline scripted companion. Optionally, a model on the user's own Groq or OpenRouter key, or a local Ollama.
4. An output guard that caps length by stage, strips lists and markdown, and blocks medical advice.

**Help and emergencies are scripted, with no model involved.**
1. The companion asks "मैं यहीं हूँ … क्या किसी को बुलाऊँ?".
2. On "yes", or after 20 seconds with no answer at emergency level, it calls family contact 1, then 2, then the helpline.
3. Calls and WhatsApp messages open on the phone itself through `tel:` and `https://wa.me/` links. No paid SMS is used.
4. Every step is logged as a `safety_event`.
5. The caregiver gets a push alert when signed in.

Long silence (two unanswered gentle checks) and bursts of rapid taps also start the flow.

**After a session**, the caregiver fills a 30-second form: mood (5 faces), topics to keep or avoid, and notes. The next session uses it to weight topics.

**Activities tab.** A caregiver-led memory activity: orientation, five words (immediate and delayed recall), and animals named in 60 s.
- It is tracked against the person's *own* first sessions. It flags sudden low orientation, and drops that hold for two sessions in a row.
- It uses its own word lists, not taken from MMSE, MoCA or any licensed test. It is **not a diagnostic test**.

**Optional account and sync.** Without an account everything stays on the phone. With email + password, the caregiver's phone and the elder's phone stay in step. A server cron then sends:
- "medicine time" pushes;
- a missed-dose alert to the caregiver when a dose is not confirmed within the escalation delay.

## Run it locally

Needs Node 23.6 or later (the tests use Node's built-in TypeScript type stripping).

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173, /api is proxied to :8787
npm test             # unit tests (node:test)
npm run build        # production PWA in web/dist
```

The server is optional for trying the app. To run it:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm test
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars      # fill in JWT_SECRET; optional VAPID keys:
node scripts/vapid-keys.mjs         # prints a key pair; keep it out of git
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply sahaya --local
npx wrangler dev                    # http://localhost:8787
```

`wrangler` is not a listed dependency, so `npx` fetches it on first use.

`wrangler.toml` has a placeholder `database_id`. Nothing is deployed from this repo. To deploy:
1. `wrangler d1 create sahaya`, and put the real id in `wrangler.toml`.
2. Set each secret with `wrangler secret put` (JWT_SECRET, VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY, VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY, VAPID_SUBJECT).
3. Host `web/dist` on any static host.

```

**Why it is built this way.**
- **Offline first.** A dose confirmed on the elder's phone and a profile edit on the caregiver's phone can happen offline at the same time. The merge is field by field and does not depend on sync order.
- **Same ids on every device.** Dose rows have deterministic ids (`dose:<medicine>:<day>T<time>`), so the phone and the server create the same row and never duplicate it.
- **No paid services.** Free browser speech, no SMS gateway, and the offline companion by default.

## Limitations (please read)

- **Not a medical device.** No diagnosis, no stage assessment, no dose advice. The activity flags only point at change against the person's own earlier sessions, for a doctor to look at. They are not validated against any clinical instrument.
- **A web app cannot fully lock an Android phone.**
  - Elder mode uses fullscreen, the Screen Wake Lock API, a portrait lock where allowed, and a back-button trap.
  - The home button, the notification shade and the app switcher still work.
  - For a true kiosk, use Android's screen pinning ("App pinning") alongside the app.
- **Reminders without the server only fire while the app is open.** Browsers have no reliable scheduled offline notifications.
  - With the server, pushes need a connection.
  - The cron runs every 5 minutes, so a reminder can arrive up to 5 minutes late.
  - On iPhone, Web Push works only after the app is added to the Home Screen (iOS 16.4+).
- **Listening (speech to text).** In Chrome, speech recognition sends audio to Google's servers and needs internet.
  - Sahaya only listens if the consent record allows cloud audio.
  - Otherwise it uses big tap buttons.
  - Speaking uses the phone's own voices; Hindi needs the Google TTS Hindi voice installed on Android.
  - Firefox has no speech recognition.
- **Languages.** The safety keywords cover Hindi, Hinglish, English, Marathi and Gujarati.
  - The offline scripted companion speaks Hindi and English. Marathi and Gujarati profiles use Hindi until those banks are written.
  - Dialect (Bundeli, Malwi, Chhattisgarhi, Varhadi) shapes the model prompt only.
- **Optional model providers.** Groq, OpenRouter and Ollama are optional and off by default.
  - A key the user enters is stored unencrypted in this browser's IndexedDB.
  - Text sent to a model leaves the device.
  - Paid speech providers (Sarvam, ElevenLabs) exist only as interface stubs with no network code. Bhashini is not wired yet.
- **Time zone.** Medicine times use a fixed offset (IST by default, `TZ_OFFSET_MIN` on the server). There is no daylight-saving handling.
- **Device-only data.** The PIN hash, the family photo and the extra worry words stay on the phone where they were entered and do not sync. One elder profile per phone.
- **Account security.** There is no password reset and no login rate limiting yet. Sign-up always creates a caregiver account; other roles need an admin.
- **Hosting.**
  - D1's free tier enforces daily read/write limits; past them, queries fail until midnight UTC ([changelog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-09-01-d1-free-tier-limit-enforcement/)).
  - Workers' free plan allows 5 cron triggers and 10 ms CPU per cron run ([limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits)). Sahaya uses one.
- **Helpline numbers.** Elderline (14567, 8 am to 8 pm) and 112 are offered as choices with their sources. Check that the number works in your area before relying on it.
- **Test data only.** All screenshots and test fixtures use synthetic people ("Test Elder 1", "Test Daughter", 90000 0000x numbers). No real person's data is in this repository.
